Link for model download, since the models are too large to upload to Github:

If both the data folder called "AI data" and "Models" is added to "My drive" then the "Test_pipeline.ipynb" can be run to replicate the 2D segmentation results 
and the "3D_unet_test_pipeline.ipynb" can be run to replicate the 3D results. Note that the 3D implementation has high memory requirements. 

If it is wished to retrain the model, the files "2D_unet_full_script.ipynb" or "3D_unet_full_script.ipynb" can be run.
